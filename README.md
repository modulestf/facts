# facts

`mtf-facts` is an offline Go CLI that parses Terraform module trees and reports deterministic facts: rule results, candidate findings with evidence, interface and schema diffs.

It serves two uses:

- Module review: a facts bundle that lets a model reviewer skip the rules a parser can decide.
- Module authoring: `lint`, a provider coverage `ledger` check, and `schema-diff` for provider upgrades.

Status: design. No code yet.
